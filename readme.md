## Installation
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andregamoraes/node_sort.git
cd node_sort

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Building the Project
Since this project is written in TypeScript, you need to compile it before running:
```sh
npm run build
```
This will generate the compiled JavaScript files in the `dist/` directory.

## Running the Code
After building, you can run the compiled code with:
```sh
node dist/index.js
```
Or, if using TypeScript directly:
```sh
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

## Usage Example
You can use the sorting functions in your project by importing them:

```ts
import { selectionSort } from './selectionSort';

const numbers = [4, 2, 3, 1, 5];
console.log(selectionSort(numbers)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
